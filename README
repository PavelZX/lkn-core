1. Overview
═══════════

  lkn-core is a framework for creating game servers. It is written in
  Elixir and implements a home-grown ECS supervisor tree and a
  mechanism to dynamically spawn new instances for incoming players
  whenever it is necessary.

2. Contributing
═══════════════

  lkn-core is a Free Software distributed under the terms of the
  AGPLv3+ License. The codebase is hosted at several locations,
  including a Github repository[1] and a self-hosted
  repository[2]. There also is a pijul repository[3], because I
  believe using pijul for lkn is a good way to contribute to pijul
  without having to write code.

  If you want to submit a patch, feel free to do so in the manner you
  find the more appropriate. For instance, you can:
  · open a Github pull request if you have an account.
  · send me a git remote I can fetch
  · send me a patch using the Nest (pijul)
  · send me an email with your patches

  The most important thing is: by providing me a patch, you agree it
  may become available to the lkn-core users under the terms of the
  AGPLv3+ license. Moreover, consider lkn-core will soon be published
  to Hex.mp and so will be your contributions if they find their way
  to the master branch. Finally, regarding the fact that the codebase
  is kept under two DVCS, know that I might create a patch of your
  changes with the tool you didn't use.
