# lkn.

**lkn.** is an attempt to write a playable 2D MMORPG with Elixir and an
actor-based model.

## Components

### lkn.foundation

### lkn.core

## Getting Started

The **lkn.** codebase is kept under [pijul](https://pijul.com) vcs. To get the
code, you have to use `pijul clone`:

```
pijul clone https://nest.pijul.com/lthms/lkn
```

We use `mix` under the hood, but for simplicity, the main commands are
abstracted away thanks to a `Makefile`. Then:

```
# compile the project from scratch
make
# build doc, generate test coverage, execute the tests
make test
```
